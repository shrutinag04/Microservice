# Microservice

This repository contains basic implementations for creating and managing microservices.

- **SocialMediaApp** - RESTful services built using Spring Boot with integrated Swagger UI for API documentation.
- **limit-service** - A test microservice connected to a Spring Cloud Config Server.
- **Currency Exchange Service** - A microservice that provides currency exchange rates, invoked by the Currency Conversion Service.

Each service demonstrates essential microservice architecture principles and is designed for easy integration and scalability.
